# Canvas Dashboard Manager
**A Chome Extension that adds the basic missing tools to Canvas' Dashboard**

The [Canvas LMS](https://www.canvaslms.com/) currently lacks a great amount of basic tools to control the look and feel of the dashboard view. There's nothing worse than having to stare at a horrible `.gif` that your lecturer has assigned to the class, day in and day out.

Canvas Dashboard Manager aims to solve this.

## Current Features

* Adds additional control to the the dashboard "card-view" context menu

* Upload custom card background images

* Remove existing images (show colour only)

* Reset to original view
